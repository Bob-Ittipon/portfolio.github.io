           <p>Hello there I’m Ittipon or you can call me Bob. I’m from Bangkok, Thailand. I moved to the United States 4 years ago for my master's degree.<br /><br /> </p>

           <p> As an Android developer experience that I have had before. Back in Thailand, the first company that I worked for is a software house company. I joined them in the junior level Android developer position. In this company was so busy but it's good for me. In the first month of working, I have to handle 2 main jobs and 1 maintained, and it is due in 4 months later as my probation. With that hardworking, I have to collaborate with my team and that makes us get closing so fast. Finally, we passed the probation together and work together for 2 years. We created so many software within that time, I think it's more than 15 systems (website, mobile app, backend side, our own APIs) my first job was really benefited me, growing me a lot in terms of software development, working as a team, how to handle multi-project, time handling, and being a good person.
        
            <br /><br /></p>
            
            <p>I would like to make software that creates a huge impact for people and the World. That is why I joined my second company which is the research and development center of my hometown.<br /></p><p> After I have done some project for them, I realized that my knowledge was not enough, so I choose to do my master and planning to find a job in the state to open my eyes, explore the World, learn to be better, and also as I mentioned, to follow my goal that I would like to create very useful software for people and the World.
